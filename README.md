# Machine Learning I & II - Coursework Repository

This repository contains all my projects and assignments for the two-semester **Machine Learning** sequence at the Czech Technical University (CTU).

This comprehensive sequence covered the full spectrum of machine learning, from foundational principles and classic models to advanced topics in neural networks, dimensionality reduction, and NLP.


**Technology Stack:**

* **Python**
* **Scikit-learn**
* **Pandas**
* **NumPy**
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn**
* **PyTorch**

## Topics Covered

### Machine Learning I: Foundations

* **Supervised Learning:** Building and evaluating models for regression and classification tasks.
* **Unsupervised Learning:** Implementing clustering algorithms.
* **Model Validation:** Techniques for assessing model quality and preventing overfitting.

### Machine Learning II: Advanced Methods

* **Advanced Supervised Learning:** Kernel methods (e.g., SVMs) and an introduction to **Neural Networks**.
* **Advanced Unsupervised Learning:** Dimensionality reduction techniques, including Principal Component Analysis (PCA).
* **Specialized Topics:** Fundamentals of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** and **Natural Language Processing (NLP)**.

## Projects & Homeworks

*(This repository is organized into the four main projects from the sequence.)*

### Machine Learning I
* **Homework 1:** Predicting Titanic survival using binary classification (Decision Tree, KNN), focusing on data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model tuning.
* **Homework 2:** Predicting life expectancy (regression task) by implementing a custom Random Forest and comparing it against Linear/Ridge Regression.

### Machine Learning II
* **Homework 1:** Applying dimensionality reduction (PCA, LLE) to classify high-dimensional Fashion MNIST data using SVM, Naive Bayes, and LDA.
* **Homework 2:** Building and comparing optimized Feed-Forward (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) for multi-class image classification on Fashion MNIST.
